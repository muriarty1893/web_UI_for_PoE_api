PoE Item Price Fetcher
This project is a simple web-based application for fetching item prices from the Path of Exile (PoE) economy using the poe-api-manager. The application allows users to search for items by name and retrieve their current Chaos or Divine Orb value. It also provides a basic web UI for users to interact with.

Features
Fetch Current Chaos Value: Get the equivalent Chaos Orb value of a Divine Orb.
Search for Item Prices: Search for PoE items by name and retrieve their current price in Chaos Orbs or Divine Orbs.
Search History: Keeps track of recently searched items in a history panel.
Interactive Web UI: Simple and intuitive web interface for users to interact with the API.

Example Usage
Fetching Chaos Value
The endpoint /fetch-chaos-value returns the current Chaos Orb value for a Divine Orb in JSON format:

json
Kodu kopyala
{
  "success": true,
  "chaosValue": 150
}
Searching for an Item
When searching for an item by name using the form on the main page, the itemâ€™s price and modifiers are displayed:

json
Kodu kopyala
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "name": "Headhunter",
    "divineValue": 1.5,
    "explicitModifiers": [
        "+40% to Chaos Resistance",
        "Adds 12 to 20 Chaos Damage"
    ],
    "icon": "https://www.poewiki.net/images/e/ee/Headhunter_inventory_icon.png"
  }
}
If no exact match is found, the API suggests similar items.
